# Respond

- During the incident, incoming ICMP traffic was blocked, and non-critical network services were temporarily taken offline while critical systems were restored. Logs and alerts from the firewall and IDS/IPS were reviewed to  analyze the attack. These steps ensured that the attack was contained and network services resumed normal operation efficiently.

- For future security events, the cybersecurity team will isolate affected systems to prevent further disruption to the network. Critical systems and services disrupted by the event will be restored first. The team will analyze network logs for suspicious activity and report all incidents to upper management and legal authorities as required.
