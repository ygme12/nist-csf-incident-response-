A malicious actor targeted the company with an ICMP flood attack, affecting the entire internal network. All critical network resources were disrupted, and access to internal services was temporarily lost. 
The systems most affected included the network firewall, internal servers, and essential business services. 
Initial investigation revealed that the firewall lacked rate limiting controls for ICMP traffic and did not verify source IP addresses. 
The absence of traffic monitoring and intrusion detection allowed the attack to go undetected until it caused a network outage. The incident emphasized the need to regularly audit systems, processes, and 
access controls to identify potential gaps in security.
