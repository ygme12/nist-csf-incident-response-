# Protect

To protect internal assets from future attacks, the company implemented several measures based on the incident:
- Configured firewall rules to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
- Enabled source IP verification to prevent spoofed ICMP traffic.
- Installed network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
- Deployed an IDS/IPS system to filter ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.
