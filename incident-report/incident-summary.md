A multimedia company experienced a  a security event when all network services suddenly stopped responding for 2 hours. The cybersecurity team found the disruption was caused by 
a distributed denial of services (DDoS) attack through a flood of incoming ICMP packets exploiting an unconfigured firewall. The incident disrupted internal network services and 
required immediate containment and remediation actions. The root cause was firewall misconfiguration allowing unlimited ICMP traffic.
The team responded by blocking the attack and stopping all non-critical network services, so that critical network services could be restored.
