# NIST CSF Incident Response – Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

## Project Description
Incident response project using the NIST CSF to analyze and mitigate a DoS attack. Documents identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery of affected systems, demonstrating SOC skills and real-world network security practices.

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack caused by an ICMP flood. The goal is to showcase structured incident handling, security improvement planning, and recovery strategies aligned with real-world SOC operations.
